#Volume Provisioning for Kabanero Pipelineruns

Tekton pipelines require a configured volume that is used by the framework to share data across tasks. The build task, which uses Buildah, also requires a volume mount. The minimum required volume size is five Gi.

## Static Persistent Volumes

If you are using an unmanaged cluster, you can set up a persistent volume to be used by the pipelinerun. A simple persistent volume definition is provided in the following example. Update the path and other values in your `pv.yaml` file provided in this repository, to suit your requirements. 

For instance, the following example is configured for local storage. You might edit this file to configure it for NFS, the standard configuration in a production environment.

1. Log in to your cluster. For example, for OKD

```
oc login <master node IP>:8443
```

2. Clone the [kabanero-pipeplines repo](https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines.git)

```
git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines
```

3. Clone the `pv.yaml` file in this repository and apply it.

```
cd ./pipelines/common
oc apply -f pv.yaml -n kabanero
```

## Dynamic Volume Provisioning

If your cluster is running in a public cloud, dynamic volume provisioning is an easier option. For more information on how to use storage class and configMap through Tekton for dynamic provisioning of the persistent volumes	, see the document [How are resources shared between tasks](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md#how-are-resources-shared-between-tasks).

Your persistent volume must be configured in accordance with your cloud providerâ€™s default [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#introduction). Below are some of the recommendations for dynamic volume provisioning while running Kabanero pipelines.

1. For running the Kabanero pipelines you should have your [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#introduction) to be configured to provision atleast 5Gi of persistent volume dynamically.

2. The storage class used for dynamic provisioning should have the reclaiming policy of `Recycle` if you have the requirement to run multiple pipelines and that too frequently. Usually if the `default` [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#introduction) is configured in the public cloud the reclaiming policy is `delete`. To know more about the reclaiming policy go [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reclaiming)

#### Feature Coming soon for Dynamic provisioning using customized [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#introduction)

1. Create your customized [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#introduction) for dynamic provisioning for the persistent volumes.

example: Example showing the `storageclass` template

2. Tell the Tekton to use your storage class via [configMap](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md#how-are-resources-shared-between-tasks), so when the kabanero pipelines are run, tekton can use your custom storage class to provision dynamic persistent volumes.
